 Qbox First-Principles Molecular Dynamics
 ========================================

 Qbox is a C++/MPI/OpenMP implementation of First-Principles Molecular Dynamics.
 It implements electronic structure calculations within the framework
 of Density Functional Theory, using a plane-wave basis set and
 norm-conserving pseudopotentials.
